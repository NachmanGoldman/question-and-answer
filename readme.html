<h2>Name: <small>Nachman Goldman</small></h2>

<h3>This program shares answers among users.</h3>
<p>I built map to store the questions and answers, the index (or key) is the index of the question,<br>
and the value is my own class that have a String to the question and ArrayList to answer of this question. <br>
    Also I used four Servlets to manage the program. <br>
    1. ShowQuestions (index-servlet) - reads the all questions and display them. <br>
    2. WriteAnswer - display an HTML form to answer a question. <br>
    3. AddAnswerToArray - add the answer to ArrayList in the QandA. <br>
    4. SendAnswer - send ArrayList of answers (by get method). <br>
    and one more js file to frontend issues. <br>
